# How It All Started ðŸš€  

On **January 9, 2025**, I decided to start building a home server after failing with a VPS.  

### The Problem ðŸ¤¦  
The failure was entirely my faultâ€”I purchased a VPS with a data center located far from my country.  
- I live in **Jakarta**, but the VPS data center was in **India**, causing terrible latency.  
- Frustrated, I gave up on that VPS.  
- Fortunately, the provider offered refunds, so I got my money back and learned a valuable lesson.  

### The Turning Point ðŸ’¡  
Even after that, I still wanted to:  
1. Deploy my projects and portfolio online.  
2. Understand how production environments work.  

But instead of buying another VPS, I stumbled upon something more exciting.  

While scrolling through YouTube, I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMSxYOZMl0U&feature=youtu.be) that showed how you could build a server at home using an **old laptop**.  
- I immediately decided to try it.  
- After spending a day understanding the video, I installed **Proxmox** on my laptop and turned it into a home server.  

### The Learning Curve ðŸ“š  
During that week, I dived into:  
- **Networking Basics**: How to make my local server accessible to the internet.  
- **Computer Fundamentals**: How computers were created and how they work.  
- **Internet Mechanics**: How data travels and how everything connects.  

### A Surprising Realization ðŸ¤”  
One thing that stood out to me:  
- Internet connections arenâ€™t fully wireless!  
- At least in my country, ISPs still rely on **cables** to deliver internet access.  

Learning all of this completely changed the way I think about computers and the internet.
